# Problem Statement
The goal of the analysis is to:
- create an online flyer that will advertize their product
- display the products on social media
- use the brand colour to design an advert that will be pleasing to view

# Skills and Tools Demonstrated
  - Coreldraw
  - importation of images that showcases their product
  - the use of good colour combination, good choice of fonts and arrangment

# Design Modeling 
Coreldraw is well programmed that is easy to navigate and craft out a great design using the tools. However, as someone who understands the the software and knows how to create a beautiful design with my creative mind. I had to apply my skill to enable me pass all the vital information needed to advert their product and encourage people to patronize them. so I did used their brand colour, good fonts and i also made sure that all my work are well aligned so it can come out with a great finishing.
